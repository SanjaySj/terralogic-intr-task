Build a Searchable List with Pagination

## Objective:

Create a list of items (e.g., products, users, etc.) and implement search, filter, and pagination functionality.

## Requirements:

* Implement a list of items with basic details (name, description, etc.).
* Add a search bar that filters items by name or description.
* Add pagination to split the list into pages (e.g., 10 items per page).
* Use Angular Material for UI components (e.g., table, pagination, input).
* Mock API calls using HttpClient (or use a real API if available).

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
