Build a Searchable List with Pagination

## Objective:

Create a list of items (e.g., products, users, etc.) and implement search, filter, and pagination functionality.

## Requirements:

* Implement a list of items with basic details (name, description, etc.).
* Add a search bar that filters items by name or description.
* Add pagination to split the list into pages (e.g., 10 items per page).
* Use Angular Material for UI components (e.g., table, pagination, input).
* Mock API calls using HttpClient (or use a real API if available).

For Mock: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

## Output:

* Implemented displaying a list of posts due to the unavailability of the API.
